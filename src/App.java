         * Question 1
         * (5 Points) Explain why the (repaired1)ForwardElimination algorithm on page
         * 210 of Levitin fails to provide a solution for:
         * x1 + x2 + x3 = 6
         * x1 + x2 + 2x3 = 9
         * x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 = 14
         * despite the fact that x = (1, 2, 3) or x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 3 can be easily
         * verified as a solution to the system.
         * ANSWER: This system of equations cannot be solved by normal
         * ForwardElimination because it could be distorted by rounding errors
         * 
         * 
         * How does the BetterForwardElimination algorithm on page 211 of Levitin rem-
         * edy this?
